# Bootnode audits 

I am planning to proceed with the following audits to bootnodes:

1. Go through polkadot-sdk / encointer / paseo chain-specs and
compare them with the ibp-network/config/bootnodes.json file.
2. Write helper functions to find missing entries.
3. Fill in the missing entries based on the official chain-specs.
4. Notify about missing bootnode entries to the syncicate members.
5. Once all bootnodes are added, develope a script to check the bootnodes.
6. Write daily monitoring that all bootnodes are in syncable condition.
