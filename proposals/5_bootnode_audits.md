# Bootnode audits 

I am planning to proceed with the following audits to bootnodes:

1. [x] Go through polkadot-sdk / encointer / paseo chain-specs and
compare them with the ibp-network/config/bootnodes.json file.
2. [x] Write helper functions to find missing entries.
3. [x] Fill in the missing entries based on the official chain-specs.
4. [x] Notify about missing bootnode entries to the syncicate members.
5. [ ] Once all bootnodes are added, develope a script to check the bootnodes.
6. [ ] Write daily monitoring workflow that all bootnodes are in syncable condition.
