### Proposal for Status Update Calls

To bolster communication within our community and facilitate a shared understanding
of our developmental trajectory, I'm proposing the initiation of regular status update
calls. These calls will serve as a platform for collaborative discussion, support, and
progress tracking, crucial for maintaining momentum in our development efforts.

**1. Monthly Private Calls:**

- **Frequency:** Monthly
- **Participants:** Exclusively for members and curators within our Matrix channel.
- **Content:** An in-depth review of ongoing projects, technical challenges, and strategic
  initiatives. This will be a candid forum for members to voice concerns, share solutions,
  and align on the priorities and support required.
- **Accessibility:** The calls will be recorded and transcribed for internal reference,
  ensuring that those unable to attend can still benefit from the discussions.

**2. Quarterly Public Calls:**

- **Frequency:** Quarterly
- **Participants:** Open to the entire community.
- **Content:** A high-level overview of the progress made, forthcoming plans, and
  overarching strategic direction. We will celebrate milestones, outline future plans,
  and present opportunities for community engagement.
- **Accessibility:** These calls will be recorded and shared with the community,
  enhancing transparency and inclusivity.

**Participation and Purpose:**

Participation in these calls will be entirely voluntary. Since discontinuing regular
development calls, we've observed a palpable slow-down in development progress.
By reinstating these calls, we aim to break the silos, promote knowledge sharing,
and address the overwhelming nature of the challenges we face. The ultimate goal
is to foster a collaborative environment that supports each member's contributions and needs.
